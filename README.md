The paper describes a microcontroller-based vehicle security and tracking system that makes use of GPS and GSM technologies.
The major goal of the system's design is to track a vehicle's location, accident detection and enable or disable its ignition at any time if user/owner wants to, using a dedicated Mobile Application using Flutter.
The Arduino UNO microcontroller in the developed system processes the NMEA data provided by the GPS module to provide the latitude and longitude coordinate values of a specific location through the app.
A gyro sensor was used to determine the vehicle's x-y displacement. When an accident happens, the vehicle's instantaneous coordinates are collected using a GPS module and sent to the relatives or response departments via a GSM module.
The proposed system is user friendly, easily installable, and accessible, and it may be utilized for a variety of purposes.
The device not only finds the target's position, turns off its ignition but also acta as an accident detection system.
